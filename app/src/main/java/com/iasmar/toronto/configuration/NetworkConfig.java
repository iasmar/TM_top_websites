    /**
     * Configure this client to retry or not when a connectivity problem is encountered. By default, this client silently recovers from the following problems:
     * <p>
     * Unreachable IP addresses. If the URL's host has multiple IP addresses, failure to reach any individual IP address doesn't fail the overall request. This can increase availability of multi-homed services.
     * Stale pooled connections. The ConnectionPool reuses sockets to decrease request latency, but these connections will occasionally time out.
     * Unreachable proxy servers. A ProxySelector can be used to attempt multiple proxy servers in sequence, eventually falling back to a direct connection.
     * <p>
     * Problems:
     * there might be other problems appear that we want to retry.
     * such as:
     * failed SSL handshake
     * <p>
     * Solution:
     * Set this to false to avoid retrying requests when doing so is destructive.
     * In this case the calling application should do its own recovery of connectivity failures.
     * By implement our own retry. by setting #MAX_RETRY.
